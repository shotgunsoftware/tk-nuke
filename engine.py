class NukeEngine(sgtk.platform.Engine):
    """
    An engine that supports Nuke 6.3v5+, Hiero 9.0+, and Nuke Studio 9.0+

    **Bootstrap Flow**

    The code path for the bootstrap routine for Nuke, Nuke Studio, and Hiero is quite
    complex due to the support of all three modes of the application.

    - All three Nuke modes make use of the "generic" bootstrap routine in
      tk-multi-launchapp. There is still Nuke- and Hiero-specific logic in
      that app, but it is there for the sake of backwards compatibility
      should someone still be using the tk-hiero engine or an old version
      of tk-nuke.

    - There are, in essence, two code paths for the bootstrap: Nuke in one and
      Hiero/Nuke Studio in the other. Nuke Studio acts much more like Hiero than it
      does Nuke, and as such shares many similarities when it comes to the bootstrap
      process.

    Step 1:
        The tk-multi-launchapp app will go into its "generic" bootstrap routine and
        will look in the engine structure for `tk-nuke/python/startup/bootstrap.py`.
        This is the first block of logic that will be executed, regardless of whether
        it is Nuke, Nuke Studio, or Hiero that is being launched. This logic handles
        setting either the NUKE_PATH or HIERO_PLUGIN_PATH environment variables,
        depending on which mode is being launched.

    Step 2:
        With the appropriate path variable set in #1, the `tk-nuke/python/startup`
        directory is now available to Nuke at launch as a location to look for both
        `init.py` and `menu.py` scripts to be run on launch. It's worth noting that
        the order of operations for Nuke (regardless of mode) is to execute init.py
        first, before the GUI is loaded, and menu.py later after most of the Nuke
        application is up and running and any file loads have completed.

    Step 3:
        Startup of the DCC application is under way at this point. If Nuke is launching
        in a no-UI mode, then the `init.py` is responsible for continuing the bootstrap,
        otherwise `tk-nuke/python/startup/menu.py` is in charge. In either case, the
        `tk-nuke/python/startup` directory is added to `sys.path` and its `sgtk_startup.py`
        module is loaded, which executes its own `bootstrap_sgtk()` function.

    Step 4:
        The `bootstrap_sgtk()` function handles initializing SGTK and starting up
        the tk-nuke engine.

    .. NOTE:: There is also an addition made to the `NUKE_PATH` environment variable
              in the engine initialization routine here in `engine.py`. This adds the
              root-level `tk-nuke/startup` directory, which contains a `menu.py` that
              is utilized during script load in the Nuke mode of the DCC. This is needed
              because the bootstrap routine outlined in the steps above only occurs at
              launch time, but NOT on script open. This is an important distinction, because
              each file open operation Nuke performs spawns a new process, which itself needs
              to then have the engine's `tk-nuke/python` directory added to `sys.path`.

    **Nuke Event Callbacks**

    During the bootstrap process described above, event callbacks are registered with
    Nuke. The events of interest are OnScriptLoad and OnScriptSave. Interest is registered
    in these events in `tk-nuke/python/tk_nuke/__init__.py`, which is also where the
    callbacks themselves are defined.
